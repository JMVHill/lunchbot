# Setup

`pip install slackclient`

Create a config file ./config.py with the following
```slack_token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"```

# Running

`./lunchbot channelspecs... -- botspecs...`

This runs those bots, listening on the specified channels.

`botspec` may be a bot name, such as `ps4bot`, or a name and alias, such as `gamebot:ps4bot`, which will expose ps4bot logic under the name `gamebot` (in the specified channels)
`channelspec` may be a channel name or `*`, for all channels (this should be quoted to avoid shell expansion)

Note that lunchbot is written in python2.7.

# Banter

PS4 banter is contained in `ps4-banter.txt` - each listed under a category. Adding `-champ` to the category (except for `kickoff`) will cause that message to only be sent if the target of the message is one of the top three players.
