# Setup

`pip install slackclient`

Create a config file ./config.py with the following
```slack_token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"```

# Running

`./lunchbot channels... -- bots...`

This runs those bots, listening on the specified channels.

Note that lunchbot is written in python2.7.

# Banter

PS4 banter is contained in `ps4-banter.txt` - each listed under a category. Adding `-champ` to the category (except for `kickoff`) will cause that message to only be sent if the target of the message is one of the top three players.
